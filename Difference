The Main Difference between Update Model and Try Update Model is that

UpdateModel() -- will throws an exception

TryUpdate Model() -- will not throw exception

UpdateModel() -- inspects all the HttpRequest inputs such as posted form data,
query string, cookies, and server variables an populates the object.

TryUpdateModel() -- will not look into httpRequest 

Both are used to  update the model with the form values and perform the validations.

It is one of the case in model  binding.
